# BLDC-Actuator-Cyclodial-Drive-

Status: Completed - Superceded by BLDC-Actuator-Planetary

BDLC Actuator powered by mj5208 motor and Moteus 4.9 Controller

Designed in Fusion 360

Description:

A cheap, 3D printable (FDM), 10:1 cyclodial gear reducer with two cylodial disk designed to be mounted around the mj5208 outrunner blushless motor to create a self contained actuator (quasi-direct drive). Originally intended to be used in robots similar to MIT Mini Cheetah and MJBot Quadruped (however size constrainted limited its application).
 
Dimensions: 92.40mm x 75mm x 75mm (Revision 3)

Issues:

Efficency - Large reduction results in high friction and stiction in system even with bearings
3D printed tolerance

Height of actuator limits application

Motor does not fit

Fragile motor and controller mount

Bearing fit
